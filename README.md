# Flight-Price-Prediction
This project uses machine learning to predict flight ticket prices based on various features such as airline, departure and arrival times, duration, number of stops, and date of travel. The model is trained on a dataset containing flight pricing information and utilizes feature engineering techniques to improve prediction accuracy.  

Features:
Data preprocessing and feature selection
Machine learning model training and evaluation
Hyperparameter tuning for improved performance

Technologies Used:
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)
Machine Learning algorithms (Random Forest)
I used Visual Studio Code for this project

Reference
I have reviewed the documentation on IBM to acquire a fundamental understanding of machine learning and have also utilized their YouTube videos to gain a deeper comprehension of.
I completed this project with the assistance of a YouTube video from the channel NEURALNINE, and I will provide the link below.
